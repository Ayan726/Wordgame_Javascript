# Welcome to HACKTOBERFEST 2023 

This year I have decided to make a game of Boggle whilst learning HTML, CSS & Javascript. 
The basic structure of the game is there, but as I'm only learning, there is plenty of room for improvement. 

Before you get started, make sure you've signed up at the <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com">offical Hacktoberfest website.</a>



## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

* Star and fork this Repository using the buttons in the top on the right corner of the screen.
* Clone your forked repository to your PC 
* Create a new branch for your contributions 
* Add your files containing your changes, commit and push
* Create a pull request
* Wait for your pull request to merge, (I will get to them as quickly as I can, but depending on volume it may take a little time)
* Get atleast 4 pull request's merged to earn hacktoberfest' swags
* Note:- Always make more than 4 pull requests.Let's say you have made only 4 pull requests to different projects,
but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be counted and 
then you have the remaining 3 valid pull requests if these projects are not excluded.

### PULL REQUESTS ONLY COUNT TOWARDS YOUR TOTAL IF THEY'VE BEEN MADE IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 

Once you've made your contributions, you can check your progress and see your rewards <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/profile/">on your Hacktoberfest Profile</a> 


## CAN'T CODE? 

No Worries, There are things such as Wikis that can be contributed to which require no coding knowledge.

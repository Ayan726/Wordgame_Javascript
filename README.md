# Welcome to HACKTOBERFEST 2023

This year I have decided to make a game of Boggle whilst learning HTML, CSS & Javascript.
The basic structure of the game is there, but as I'm only learning, there is plenty of room for improvement.

Before you get started, make sure you've signed up at the <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com">offical Hacktoberfest website.</a>

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

- Star and Fork this repository using the buttons in the top on the right corner of the screen.
- Clone your forked repository from your github account, to your computer.
- Create a new branch for your contributions.
- Add your files containing your changes, commit and push to your branched repo.
- Create a pull request.
- Wait for your pull request to merge, (I will get to them as quickly as I can, but depending on volume it may take a little time)
- Get at least 4 pull request's merged to earn Hacktoberfest swag.
- Note:- Always make more than 4 pull requests.
  - Let's say you have only made 4 pull requests to different projects, but one project is excluded from Hackoctoberfest event, then this pull request will not be counted, therefore only 3 valid pull requests have been successful. Not enough for swag from Hacktoberfest.

## HOW TO: Fork, Clone, Create New Branch, Make Changes, Send Pull Request

Instructions to help you do this are in the [instructions.md](/instructions.md)

### PULL REQUESTS ONLY COUNT TOWARDS YOUR TOTAL IF THEY'VE BEEN MADE IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER

## CAN'T CODE?

No Worries, There are things such as Wikis that can be contributed to which require no coding knowledge.
